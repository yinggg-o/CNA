/* ******************************************************************
   Unfinished Alternating bit protocol.  Adapted from
   ALTERNATING BIT AND GO-BACK-N NETWORK EMULATOR: VERSION 1.1  J.F.Kurose

   Network properties:
   - one way network delay averages five time units (longer if there
   are other messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger
   - packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion)
   or lost, according to user-defined probabilities
   - packets will be delivered in the order in which they were sent
   (although some can be lost).

   Modifications (6/6/2008 - CLP): 
   - removed bidirectional code and other code not used by prac. 
   - fixed C style to adhere to current programming style
   (7/8/2009 - CLP)
   - converted to Alt Bit
