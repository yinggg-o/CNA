### Assignment1: Web Server
A simple web server to handle HTTP requests from clients and send back appropriate responses. Including handle GET and POST requests, and process URL parameters. You will also need to implement basic error handling and security measures. This assignment will give you a chance to practice working with networking concepts and the HTTP protocol, as well as gain experience with server-side programming.

### Assignment2: TCP(Alternative bit, Go back N) simulator
"The TCP (Alternative bit, Go back N) simulator is a tool that allows users to simulate the behavior of the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) in a computer network. The simulator uses the Alternative bit and Go back N algorithms to manage the flow of data between sender and receiver nodes.

### Assignment3: Routing Algo(Dijkstra)
"The routing algorithm (Dijkstra) program is a java program that allows users to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The program utilizes the Dijkstra algorithm, which is a popular method for finding the shortest path in a graph with weighted edges.

The program allows users to input a graph with weighted edges and specify a source and destination node. It will then use the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between the two nodes, taking into account the weights of the edges. The program will output the resulting shortest path, as well as the distance and the intermediate nodes traversed.
